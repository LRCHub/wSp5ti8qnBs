Falling apart, I'm falling apart
Her ocean eyes, they stole my heart
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
Will this ever end? I don't know where to start
Every day I think of you, old shit that we used to do
Silhouettes underneath the moon
Black night but the sky was blue
I hit hard when it suddenly changed
Love that we had all thrown away
Take it back if I could
But I'm caught in a trap that I can't escape
Gone, yeah, the loneliness-killer called love
Now it's gone, yeah
The touch of your skin, the warmth of your blood
I tried to forget all of this, but it's hard after all that we did
I tried to forget all of this
'Cause the thought of you is making me sick
I'm missing little things that you say
All the times you call my name
When you laughed at the jokes I made
That happiness no one could take
Me and you making new memories daily
But without you, I haven't made any lately
I'm watching your favorite movies
Praying that it ended safely, yeah
Falling apart, I'm falling apart
Her ocean eyes, they stole my heart
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
Will this ever end? I don't know where to start
Falling apart, I'm falling apart
Her ocean eyes, they stole my heart
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
Tell me what it is about you
Why I fell for your love when I found you
Picking me up like a teapot
Then tipping me over like cows do
We would laugh every day, kiss with a K
Lay on the beach, swim in a lake
Talk about problems, planned out our future
Felt like a winner but now I'm a loser
Lost the love of my life
Lost the kick in my side
No bandage this big
Feeling the sickness inside
Remember that sweater you gave me
Remember those cookies you made me
Or the vacation in Paris
Our neighbors we both thought were shady
I'm missing little things that you say
All the times you call my name
When you laughed at the jokes I made
That happiness no one could take
Me and you making new memories daily
But without you, I haven't made any lately
I'm watching your favorite movies
Praying that it ended safely, yeah
Falling apart, I'm falling apart
Her ocean eyes, they stole my heart
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
Will this ever end? I don't know where to start
Falling apart, I'm falling apart
Her ocean eyes, they stole my heart
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
